        <p>I'm a designer who has strayed into software engineering.</p>
        <p>
          Originally from Melbourne I started my career as a freelance graphic
          artist in ad agencies and design studios in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then joined online retailer{' '}
          <ExtLink href="https://ssense.com">SSENSE</ExtLink> in Montr√©al,
          wearing many hats in true startup fashion. Everything from building a
          photo retouching team, to redesigning & rebuilding the ecommerce
          frontend when <span className="smcp">HTML5</span>,{' '}
          <span className="smcp">CSS3</span> & jQuery were the new things, to
          managing the creative input/output as the only designer on staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling the sting of imposter syndrome, I returned to Melbourne to
          complete a Master of Design in Graphic Communication, while
          freelancing at ad agencies and writing a lot ActionScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some extended downtime in Paris, I joined a fitness startup in
          Berlin prototyping interaction design concepts for their
          augmented-reality 'Smart Trainer' product, and designing the SaaS
          platform for gym trainers and members.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last six years I've been working on{' '}
          <ExtLink href="https://fieldfolio.com">Fieldfolio</ExtLink>, a B2B
          platform for wholesalers in Australia and New Zealand, a business my
          family and I own and operate.
